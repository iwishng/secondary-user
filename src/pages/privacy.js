            <span className='block my-3'>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and our mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
              uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
              signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
              to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
              communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
              for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
              we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
              this Privacy Policy. Most web browsers and some mobile operating
              systems and our mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
              feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
              preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
              monitored and collected. If you set the DNT signal on your
              browser, we will respond to such DNT browser signals.
